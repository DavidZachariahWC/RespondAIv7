Dear Frontend Engineer,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to inform you about an important update to our API responses for both the `/sendMessage` and `/continueThread` endpoints.

We've made a crucial modification to ensure that the `threadId` is consistently returned along with the `assistantResponse` in all API responses. This change applies to both endpoints and will help maintain conversation continuity on the frontend.

Here's what you need to know:

1. **Updated Response Structure:**
   Both `/sendMessage` and `/continueThread` endpoints now return responses in the following format:

   ```json
   {
     "assistantResponse": "string",
     "threadId": "string"
   }
   ```

2. **Usage:**
   - For new conversations, use the `/sendMessage` endpoint. Store the returned `threadId` for future use.
   - For continuing conversations, use the `/continueThread` endpoint, providing the stored `threadId` in the request body.
   - Always save the `threadId` returned in the response, as it may be updated by the backend.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Update your API response handling to expect and process the `threadId` along with the `assistantResponse`.
   - Ensure that you're storing and using the most recent `threadId` for each conversation.

This change will allow for more robust conversation management and enable seamless continuation of discussions across multiple interactions.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Backend Developer
