Dear Front-End Engineer,

I hope this message finds you well. I've implemented a new endpoint in our server to add a new personality for a user. Here's what you need to know to integrate this functionality into our front-end application:

Endpoint: POST /users/:userId/personalities

Request Format:
- URL Parameter:
  - userId: The ID of the user to which we're adding the new personality.
- Request Body (JSON):
  - newPersonalityName: A string containing the name of the new personality.
  - newPersonalityDescription: A string containing the description of the new personality.

Example Request:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`http://your-api-url/users/${userId}/personalities`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    newPersonalityName: "Friendly and Outgoing",
    newPersonalityDescription: "You are warm, approachable, and always eager to engage in conversation. You use friendly language and often include encouraging words."
  }),
});
```

Response:
- Success (HTTP 201):
  ```json
  {
    "message": "New personality added successfully"
  }
  ```
- Errors:
  - 400 Bad Request: If the personality name or description is missing or empty.
  - 404 Not Found: If the user with the given userId doesn't exist.
  - 500 Internal Server Error: For any other server-side errors.

Important Notes:
1. Both the personality name and description are required and cannot be empty strings.
2. The new personality will be added to both the `personalities` and `personalitiesDescription` maps in the user's document in Firestore.
3. If a personality with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten with the new information.

Please ensure that you handle potential errors in the front-end application and provide appropriate feedback to the user. If you need any clarification or have any questions about integrating this new endpoint, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Your Backend Developer

This implementation should fulfill the requirements you specified. The new endpoint adds the personality to both the `personalities` and `personalitiesDescription` maps in Firestore, and the letter to the front-end engineer provides clear instructions on how to use the endpoint.
